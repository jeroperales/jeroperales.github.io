I’m Jeronimo Perales, a programming student based in Mar del Plata, Argentina, building a strong foundation in software development with a focus on Object-Oriented Programming. I have hands-on experience with C, Java, and am currently learning JavaScript, as well as web development basics in HTML and CSS, having worked on a few projects but still expanding my skills in these areas. Bilingual and comfortable in diverse settings, I’m fluent in both English (native) and Spanish (advanced). Passionate about technology and problem-solving, I’m eager to continue growing my skills and making an impact in the programming world.
